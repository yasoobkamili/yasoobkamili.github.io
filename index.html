                    <h2>Dumail, Naranaag</h2>
                    <p> 11 July 2021 <br> The trek begins from Naranag village, situated at around 2277 meters above sea
                        level.
                        A
                        few
                        hundred meters into the trail, we pass by ancient Hindu temples, offering a quick
                        historical stop.
                        After approximately 4 km and 2 hours of trekking, Dumail is reached at ~2400 m ASL. The trail up
                        to
                        Dumail
                        features minimal elevation gain and is rated as easy. The name “Dumail” is derived from “Du”
                        (two) and
                        “Mail” (join), marking the confluence of two rivers—Marchoi Nala and another stream originating
                        from
                        Gangbal
                        Lake. These form the Wangath River. A distinctive wooden bridge at Dumail marks the crossing
                        point to
                        the
                        next section of the trail. From Dumail, the trail transitions into a moderate gradient ascent
                        through
                        alpine
                        meadows for the next 5 km. This section involves a steady climb with scenic views of the
                        surrounding
                        forested ridgelines and open pastures. After approximately 4 additional hours of trekking, the
                        Harmukh
                        peaks
                        come into view, signaling proximity to Marchoi Valley, which sits at an altitude of about 2850
                        m. <br>

                    <h2>Rainuer, The Endless Meadow</h2>
                    <p> 11 July 2021 <br> The trek begins from Hirpora village in Shopian at approx 2385 meters above
                        sea
                        level. Trekking in this area
                        usually requires prior permission due to its proximity to sensitive zones and the Hirpora
                        Wildlife
                        Sanctuary.

                        At around 600 meters into the trail, we reached Zrado, followed by a gradual ascent to
                        Baliwal. The
                        trail transitions from forested sections of Shahkoot to more open terrain, and at approximately
                        6.5 km
                        from the
                        trailhead,we reached the Tsurgul Pass. This pass offers the view to Badgam's Shein Meuin
                        Peak and first major alpine vista,
                        opening up into expansive meadows and panoramic views of the Pir Panjal range, including
                        prominent peaks
                        like Brahmasakli(of Kulgam), Dhakyar(of Shopian), Sunder Top (of Banihal) and more.

                        After crossing the pass, a further 3.5 km leads to the final destination, Rainuer Meadows at
                        around 3185 m ASL.
                        The meadows are vast, lush, and relatively less explored, believed to be the second-largest
                        alpine
                        meadow in Kashmir. The terrain is grassy, interspersed with boulders and occasional seasonal
                        streams.

                        Although the standard route is a circuit trek (Hirpora → Rainuer → Dubjan
                        Bridge → Hirpora), we had to return via the same route due to an injury to one member.

                        During the descent, we were warmly hosted by local nomads at a hut near the trail. Around
                        15 of us were served noon chai, roti, and fresh homemade butter. Despite offering to
                        pay, the
                        nomads politely refused any compensation, showcasing typical high-altitude hospitality(PS:
                        Nomad's of Diskhal are an exception ).

                    <h2>Mahadev Peak Basecamp:Lidwas</h2>
                    <h3>Route Overview</h3>
                    <p>Originally intended as a one-day summit attempt to Mahadev Peak (3966 m ASL), the plan had to be
                        modified
                        due to road closures in Srinagar caused by a cycle race, resulting in a two-hour delay. We
                        initiated the trek from Scholar’s School, Dhara (2030 m ASL) without any breaks.

                        After the initial stretch, the trail passed Padshah Pal, followed by an approach toward Bobjan,
                        a
                        section known for high bear activity and considered one of the more dangerous segments of the
                        route.
                        Several members reported past bear encounters here.

                        Following multiple stream crossings, the trail entered Wovur Gul (I'm not sure about the name),
                        a steep and energy-intensive
                        climb.
                        After gaining elevation in Wovur Gul, Lidwas became visible at a distance. It took about an hour
                        from
                        this point to reach Lidwas.</p>
                    <h3>Lidwas & Above</h3>
                    <p>Lidwas serves as a seasonal settlement for nomadic communities during the six months of summer.
                        We reached Lidwas around 1:30 PM. Out of 20 members, 5(Faizan, Basit, Aakash, Sharik and
                        Yasoob(me)) decided to push further above Lidwas for
                        better
                        vantage points of Mahadev Peak. We ascended an additional hour, reaching an altitude of
                        approximately 3520 m ASL, which provided
                        unobstructed views of Mahadev Peak and surrounding ridgelines. On the descent back to Lidwas, a
                        wildlife
                        sighting occurred, an animal with a furry tail was initially suspected to be a fox, but was
                        later
                        confirmed via binoculars to be a Himalayan Marmot, a first-time sighting for us.</p>
                    <h3>Return Journey</h3>
                    <p>While descending, we retraced the same route. At Bobjan, a group member narrowly avoided
                        stepping
                        on a green snake, marking another notable wildlife encounter. After exiting Bobjan, the trail
                        gradually
                        eased, allowing us to recover from the more challenging sections.</p>

                        <span class="date">30 July 2023</span> <br>
                        The Shilsar Lakes trek began from Margan Top (~3700 m ASL), a high-altitude pass connecting
                        Islamabad
                        with Kishtwar, after a 120 km drive from Srinagar. The trail starts to the right of the pass
                        with an initial steep ridge followed by a gradual ascent through alpine terrain. Out of the four
                        Shilsar
                        lakes, we visited only two on this route as the remaining are more accessible from a different
                        approach. We reached Shilsar 1 (~3900 m ASL) at around 12:30 PM with an estimated surface area
                        of
                        6310 sq.
                        meters (season-dependent), followed by Shilsar 2 (~3920 m ASL) after a 20-minute trek where the
                        we had
                        lunch during rain and hail. The lakes marked my first alpine lake experience, with
                        distant
                        views of Nun and Kun peaks visible from Margan Top. I was the first to descent at around 4:00
                        PM, and had a cup of tea
                        at a
                        local dhaba owned by Majid, and departed from Margan Top at around 5:30 PM.

                        The trek to Arshan Lake began after a ~110 km drive from Srinagar to Sinthan Top (few kilometers
                        before Sinthan Top), a
                        high-altitude pass
                        in South Kashmir. From there, the trail led into Arshan Valley, and after a few hours of
                        trekking, we reached Arshan Sar (also known as Drinyan Sar). The route then continued via a
                        steep,
                        rocky ascent
                        to Drinyansar Pass (~4170 m ASL), which offers panoramic views of Zednag, Nehnag, and the Famber
                        Valley.
                        A sharp descent from the pass led to Zednag followed by Nehnag, a distinctive kidney-shaped
                        alpine lake.
                        I further explored the region by ascending to Hoksar 1 (Abdullah Sar on some maps) before
                        descending back to Zednag. We then retraced the trail back over Drinyansar Pass, closely
                        sighting a Himalayan Marmot and reached Sinthan Top by sunset,
                        completing a
                        high-altitude circuit through a rugged and scenic section of Sinthan.
